Farm Fit â€“ Smart Crop Recommendation with IoT & AI
Farm Fit is a demo platform that combines IoT sensor simulation with a machine learning model to recommend the best crops for farmers. 
The system generates soil condition data (NPK, pH, temperature, humidity, rainfall), predicts the most suitable crop, and logs the data for trend analysis. 
Our goal is to showcase how AI-powered IoT solutions can support smarter farming decisions and improve agricultural productivity.
